### My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use mix-blend-mode and background-position. Also learned about inset. And used flex-direction: row-reverse for the fist time in a project.

### Continued development

I still need practise with background images and how to position them, particularly when there is no content in the box to provide height and width.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell on background image positioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k) - This helped me with deciding on a position.
